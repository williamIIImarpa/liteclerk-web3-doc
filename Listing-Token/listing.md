# Listing Tokens

<p> Creating a token on Polkadot is often the first step for Web3 teams aiming to establish their projects within this innovative blockchain environment. The process is not as straightforward as merely minting a token; it requires a comprehensive approach that includes governance, liquidity, and community engagement. <p>

# How to listing tokens

1. Fetch Token Data:

    Use Polkadot's APIs or blockchain explorers to retrieve token details.
    Query balances for specific accounts using system.account
    Retrieve staking-related tokens or parachain-specific assets.

2. Token Categories:    

    All Tokens: Include all tokens on the Polkadot network, such as DOT and parachain tokens.
    My Tokens: Display only tokens associated with a specific account (e.g., balances held by the user).

3. Data Sources:

    Use Polkadot.js API or Substrate-based tools to fetch token balances and metadata.
    For parachain-specific tokens, query parachain state data or use cross-chain tools like XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging).

# Sorting and Filtering Tokens

1. How to Sort Tokenn (Sorting can be implemented based on specific fields:)

    * By Balance: Sort tokens by the total balance (e.g., descending order to show the largest holdings first).
    * By Name: Alphabetically sort tokens by their names or symbols.
    * By Value: Sort based on the current market price of the token (requires integration with price feeds from exchanges like Coinbase or Binance).

2. How to Filter Tokens (Filtering allows narrowing down the list based on criteria:)

    * By Type:
        -Governance tokens (e.g., DOT).
        -Parachain-specific tokens.

    * By Activity:
        -Staked vs. unstaked tokens.
        -Locked vs. liquid tokens.

    * By Account:
        -Show only tokens owned by a specific account.    


# Steps to Create a Token Listing

<p> Establish Governance Framework: Before launching a token, it is essential to set up a governance structure. This often involves creating a multisig wallet to manage funds and decisions collectively.

Token Creation: Utilize the assets pallet available on platforms like Plaza or Pop Network to create the token. This step includes defining the token's characteristics such as its name, symbol, and total supply.

Crowdfunding Mechanism: Implement a crowdfunding strategy using platforms like Polimec to raise initial capital for the project. This can help gauge community interest and secure early funding. <p>
