# Introduction

<p> Polkadot is a next-generation blockchain protocol that connects multiple specialized blockchains into a single network. It allows independent blockchains, referred to as parachains, to exchange information and transactions in a trustless way via the Polkadot Relay Chain. One of the primary advantages of Polkadot is its ability to scale through its shared security and its capability to host a variety of decentralized applications (dApps) and tokens. </p>

## Why Create a Token on Polkadot?

<p> Polkadot enables developers to create tokens that are interoperable across different blockchains within its ecosystem. These tokens can be used for a wide range of purposes, from creating decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to developing utility tokens for decentralized platforms or games. </p>

Polkadot offers two main paths for token creation:

1. EVM-Compatible Parachains: Developers can use Moonbeam or Astar Network, which are Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible parachains on Polkadot, to deploy smart contracts and create tokens.
2. Custom Parachains: Polkadot also allows you to create tokens as part of custom-built parachains, which can be fully tailored to specific use cases or applications.

## Overview of the Process

This guide will walk you through the steps required to create a token on the Polkadot network. Depending on your needs, you can either:

- Create a token using an EVM-compatible parachain (e.g., Moonbeam or Astar).
- Build a custom parachain and create tokens directly on your own chain.


By the end of this guide, you will understand the key fields and steps needed to successfully create a token on Polkadot, including example code for smart contracts and tools you can leverage.
